Taste is not good",07/09/2023,"Dabur's Maswak paste is ayurvedic by the way and it is good to use but its taste is not good due to which not everyone likes its test so use it.  Few people do. I also ordered the toothpaste from amazon in my house, but due to its taste not good and due to a couple of shortcomings, our family members have stopped using it.  And they are saying that our teeth are damaged, our gums are damaged, but I like it, but I don't like the taste, so I don't think it's very good, so I give this page and two stars."

Since I consume a lot of coffee and tea, my teeth stain very easily.Ever since I started using this product, I have reduced my caffeine intake, I have also started brushing my teeth thrice a day, I drink a lot of water, and more than usual but still I can't see any visible change.I don't know what to say, I read reviews of this product before buying it, and since most people have given positive reviews, I decided to go for it.Well, I am gonna keep using it for a month and see if this really works."

Mint taste is delightful",08/08/2023,"It's been only a day since I've tried this product. It might be awhile before I see the whitening result. However the mint taste is refreshing.  Since it's in powder form, I am worried about multiple people using it for hygiene purpose as we need to dip a damp brush in bottle to get it out. Maybe use some other form as a product? Suggestion."

Absolutely loved it",03/08/2023,"I recently bought the Perfora Teeth Whitening Powder, and I have to say, it totally exceeded my expectations! This teeth whitener is a total game-changer when it comes to getting a brighter smile, and what's even better is that it's enamel-safe. The first thing that caught my attention was its all-natural formula. I'm really conscious about using harsh chemicals, so I loved that it's made from activated charcoal and other natural ingredients. It made me feel at ease knowing that I'm using a safe and gentle product on my teeth.Using the powder was a breeze, and I was genuinely amazed by the immediate results after just a few uses. It really did a fantastic job lifting surface stains, leaving my teeth noticeably whiter and brighter. And as a bonus, it even helped reduce plaque and freshen my breath!Overall, I'm super happy with the Perfora Teeth Whitening Powder, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective and safe way to whiten their teeth. It's definitely worth every penny!"

Good product",01/08/2023,"Hey I am regular tea coffee user. My teeth has gradually turned yellowish. I needed a solution for the same. While going through a lot of products online, after reading it's reviews here, I decided to grab it. Once I received it, after using it for four days continuously, I can start to seeing a little difference in the discoloration of my teeth. However the actual results I will know after a the usage for a month atleast. But as soon as I could feel there's a little difference, I wanted to share it with the people who are struggling with the same issue. You can surely give it a try. Moreover, it's cruelty free, vegan, sls & paraben free, no artificial flavors added, non gmo. It has almost everything I look for these days before purchasing any cosmetic thing. Rest, I understand everything depends on personal experience. My experience has been good so far."

One of the concentrated and best mouth wash available in Indian market",07/04/2015,"Listerine - The name says it allVery good quality mouth wash when compared to other competitor brands in Indian marketPros:Very much concentrate (first time users might feel it bit hard though)Does gives a clean feel after the use but do NOT expect peppermint / mint feel as this is Original flavor version.As the product concentration is bit high compared to other brands, some users can use it by diluting it with water. ;)Does the work pretty and comes in solid and firmly closed cap which you take take for travel without fear of leaking.Cons:The high concentration of the product might gives burning sensation for first time users. You may try in peppermint / mint flavor instead which I personally finds less concentrate and easy for first time users.This Original is not flavored this gives a weird taste for first time users.Personal Feel:I got used to the concentration of the product and dilute it some times while using. Also I usually buy Original flavor as it gives more clean feeling than feeling peppermint in mouth ;)Conclusion:Value for money and One of the concentrated mouthwash available in Indian market. First time users please make sure you do not mug in a huge amount to mouth!"

Quite effective but Strong essence.",07/03/2017,"Listerine is very strong (though they have a range that's non-alcoholic) and I prefer the intense burn. They have quite a good range of flavours too, so it doesn't get boring, though I tend to stick with Original, Spearmint and Fresh Mint.I've tried other brands, but none of them seem to be as strong as Listerine, and often, the flavours don't taste as good either. The only flavour of Listerine that I really don't like is the flavour of the Whitening mouthwash...It is one of the pricier mouthwashes, but they are also often on sale - so it works out.___________________________________________________________________Thankyou for your giving your precious time in reading this review."

IT'S A RELIABLE LIFELONG COMPANION",25/03/2022,I use it whenever I want to feel my mouth as EXTRA FRESH. Have been using it regularly since college in the 1960's. Still at it 60 years later! Have introduced it to to numerous others. Am very glad that I started this invaluable habit decades ago.

It has strongest flavor and aroma.It stings/ You can either dilute it with water or take less to avoid burning sensation in mouth.As far as alcohol taste and sensation goes, Listerine is not hiding the fact that It uses some kind of alcohol in its ingredient.Wait for at least 30 minutes before eating something."

Avoid other flavours if you want the best effectiveness and go for this Original flavour."

Strong taste - Best in class for plaque protection.",27/05/2014,This is a really good product recommended by most of the dentists in US. I lived there for over two years. This is the best plaque protection and gum disease protection product any dentist would recommend over there. It gives mouth a great warm sensation. I personally can't take mint anyways. Again the flavor is not sweet or anything. It also gives a bit of burning sensation. Its a strong product and totally serves the purpose. Have been using it over a year now and I feel addicted to it. Highly recommended.

Tried & Tested: Rid your Dandruff along with bad breath!",16/03/2017,"Listerine contains ingredients like menthol, eucalyptol, methyl salicylate, and thymol; these are known for their antifungal properties.

The Best Anti Stain Toothpaste I have ever used",13/12/2022,"I have been using this toothpastefor almost a week now and I can honestly say it's the best stain remover oral product I have used. I have been using twice daily and can already feel benefits of the quality stain removal and whitening. The flavour of this toothpaste is one I really like and gives you that long-lasting freshness. I am a big coffee drinker and have found that over time my teeth are not as white as they once was and I do have a bit of staining on the inside of my bottom teeth. I can already see that my teeth are looking healthier and stronger even after 1 week of use. Having the stain prevention within this toothpaste is really appealing, as it's nice to know that your teeth will not just return to how they was after a period of time. Im feeling much more confident and I know in time my teeth will just keep on looking better and better. This toothpaste is definitely an expertly made product and I would highly recommend to all."

The value for money is unbeatable, especially with the bonus of receiving four toothbrushes for the price of two.

Toothpaste consistency is low. Taste is different. Amazon can certainly look into this matter to protect their customers' interests.Or its, more likely, that retail prices are highly inflated, as high as 500%, so genuine discount makes its price reasonable."

Awesome toothpaste!",10/01/2023,"I feel thankful, happy and blessed to have discovered this toothpaste (being a diabetic). No sugary taste, cleans mouth perfectly. Beautiful and safe ingredients. Although it contains many extracts, I can mainly taste cloves. Taste will feel strong to those who are used to sugary toothpastes, but it doesn't burn your mouth. One can easily get used to this toothpaste if you want a safe and healthy option. It is SLS based but just the basic amount of sulphate cleanser is there. I DON'T need to go on rinsing my mouth for half an hour like other toothpastes. After brushing, just squish water and rinse the mouth a few times. Once the strong taste in your mouth decreases, just gargle a couple times and you have a clean mouth and gut. Consistency is slightly thin and stringy as it doesn't contain fillers like chalk powder, it is cullulose gum based. But it is not messy. My teenager didn't like it as many people prefer taste. But I feel everyone deserves good health and safe products. I received it in brand's sturdy packing. Thank you Nogi!"

Worth it !!",14/09/2021,"The mint is the reason for the freshness you feel while using it. The flavour might not be of everybody's liking. I didn't like it that much but my family loved it. Just like every product, it is value for money only when you buy a combo. If you are buying for 1 family go for the pack of 2."

Best Overall Toothpaste : Colgate Charcoal Clean",27/10/2020,This is one of the highest-rated toothpaste on Amazon. Colgate's Charcoal Clean Toothpaste is basically the gold and above standard for dentists and consumers alike. This toothpaste includes Bamboo Charcoal and Mint which actually brings in a fresh feel inside the mouth that lasts for a long time. This toothpaste has various cleaning properties and also is known to purify breath. I personally believe that it has an excellent taste that isn't overpowering. Highly recommended.

Strongly recommended",21/03/2021,"It is the best tooth powder with very nice flavour n feel full day fresh. It is better then a tooth paste. I strongly recommend to use this tooth powder. The only problem with this product is sometimes their packing of the tin is loose n the powder spills from the tin that is only the issue sometimes, but overall it cannot be compared to any tooth paste. I love this tooth powder very much."

Nostalgia with excellent cleaning!",27/08/2017,"We used to use this as kids and then toothpastes took over, stopped using dental powder and lots of shops also don't keep it nowadays but I feel it's much more effective than fancy toothpastes & economical as well. Lathers a lot and the taste & smell is really good. Transported me to the past. Noticing that it removes yellowness and stains better than today's toothpastes. I had some chlorhexidine stains from dental work and they were not coming off but this powder has lightened them. Using it thrice a day. But don't brush too hard with it as it is abrasive & can affect the enamel."

Not a tooth powder, A box of harsh chemical powder",18/02/2018,"In initial days of using it will tempt you by it's smell and cleaning property but on longer use it harms you adversely. Please don't use this tooth powder, it has SLS in dry form, a detergent which we commonly find in handwash, clothes detergent, floor cleaner, Car washing chemical, even in our everyday toothpaste. I am suggesting to those who want use 100% natural go for vicco,patanjali,nogi,khadi jagriti herbs,charak,k.p.namboodiri,dabur etc....Indians are blindly using it for decades attracted by it's tactic advertisements and looks."
